                 Nutrition is the study of nutrients in food, how the body uses them, and the relationship between diet, health, and disease.
                 Nutritionists use ideas from molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics to understand how nutrients affect the human body.
                 Nutrition also focuses on how people can use dietary choices to reduce the risk of disease, what happens if a person has too much or too little of a nutrient, and how allergies work.<br>
                 <strong>Nutrients provide nourishment. Proteins, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water are all nutrients.</strong>

                    <b>Protein</b> is a macronutrient that is essential to building muscle mass. 
                    It is commonly found in animal products, though is also present in other sources, such as nuts and legumes.
                    Chemically, protein is composed of amino acids, which are organic compounds made of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur.
                    Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and proteins are the building blocks of muscle mass, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
                    The Institute of Medicine recommends that 10 to 35 percent of daily calories come from protein. How that equates to grams of protein depends on the caloric needs of the individual. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the amount of protein foods a person should eat depends on age, sex, and level of physical activity.
                    Most Americans eat enough food from this group, but need to make leaner and more varied selections of these foods. 
                    “A safe level of protein ranges from 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight [2.2 lbs.], up to 2 grams of protein per kilogram for very active athletes,” said Crandall.
                    “But most Americans truly need to be eating about 1 to 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.”

                      <p>
                          An average-sized egg contains about 6–7 grams of protein. To enable your body to use as much of that as possible, it is recommended to eat eggs cooked rather than raw.
                          Aside from their impressive protein content, eggs are low in calories, high in nutrients and especially weight loss friendly.

                      <p>
                          Lean red meat is one of the best protein sources that we can eat, containing roughly 23-28g per 4 ounce serving.
                          The protein found in red meat, as with all other animal products, is considered a complete protein source. 
                          This means that it provides our bodies with all the essential amino acids in the right amounts.

                            Summary Dried fish is extremely high in protein, which comprises up to 93% of its calories. 
                            It also contains omega-3 fatty acids and large amounts of some vitamins and minerals.

                            Yogurt is a rich source of protein.
                            One cup (245 grams) of plain yogurt made from whole milk packs about 8.5 grams of protein.
                            The protein content of commercial yogurt is sometimes higher than in milk because dry milk may be added to yogurt during processing.
                            Protein in yogurt is either whey or casein, depending on its solubility in water.

                        <b>Carbohydrates</b>  are the sugars, starches and fibers found in fruits, grains, vegetables and milk products. Though often maligned in trendy diets, carbohydrates — one of the basic food groups — are important to a healthy diet.
                        "Carbohydrates are macronutrients, meaning they are one of the three main ways the body obtains energy, or calories," said Paige Smathers, a Utah-based registered dietitian.
                        The American Diabetes Association notes that carbohydrates are the body's main source of energy. 
                        They are called carbohydrates because, at the chemical level, they contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. 
                        The recommended daily amount (RDA) of carbs for adults is 135 grams, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH); however, the NIH also recommends that everyone should have his or her own carbohydrate goal. 
                        Carb intake for most people should be between 45% and 65% of total calories. One gram of carbohydrates equals about 4 calories, so a diet of 1,800 calories per day would equal about 202 grams on the low end and 292 grams of carbs on the high end. 
                        However, people with diabetes should not eat more than 200 grams of carbs per day, while pregnant women need at least 175 grams.

                        Although often synonymous with malting – and making different forms of alcoholic beverages – barley is one of the healthiest whole grains. 
                        It’s loaded with fibre – containing more than brown rice – as well as selenium (an antioxidant that helps with cell damage), phosphorous and manganese.

                      <p>
                        As a great source of whole grains, oats contain a heart-protective starch called beta-glucan that can help lower high cholesterol and potentially help reduce the risk of certain cancers. 
                        Their fiber (and rich texture) make them particularly filling for breakfast, helping you avoid the prelunch call to snack.

                        Bread may be leavened by naturally occurring microbes, chemicals, industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure aeration. 
                        Commercial bread commonly contains additives to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, nutrition, and ease of production.

                     <b>Fat</b> are an essential part of our diet and is important for good health. 
                     There are different types of fats, with some fats being healthier than others. 
                     To help make sure you stay healthy, it is important to eat unsaturated fats in small amounts as part of a balanced diet.
                     When eaten in large amounts, all fats, including healthy fats, can contribute to weight gain. 
                     Fat is higher in energy than any other nutrient and so eating less fat overall is likely to help with weight loss.
                     All foods containing fat have a mix of specific types of fats. 
                     Even healthy foods like chicken and nuts have small amounts of saturated fat, though much less than the amounts found in beef, cheese, and ice cream. 
                     Saturated fat is mainly found in animal foods, but a few plant foods are also high in saturated fats, such as coconut, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil.

                          Often thought of as a high-fat food, steak is actually not as high in fat as you may think, particularly if you choose leaner cuts. 
                          What's more, lean beef is an excellent source of protein, iron, and zinc—all important nutrients.

                     <b>Vitamins</b> are as essential for living as air and water. Not only do they keep your body healthy and functional, 
                     they protect you from a variety of diseases.
                     Vitamins are organic substances produced by plants or animals. 
                     Vitamins are divided into two categories: water soluble—which means the body expels what it does not absorb—and fat soluble where leftover amounts are stored in the liver and fat tissues as reserves. 
                     The water-soluble vitamins are the eight B vitamins (B-1, B-2, B-3, B-5, B-6, B-7, B-9, and B-12) and vitamin C. 
                     The fat-soluble vitamins are A, D, E, and K.

                    <b>Minerals</b> are inorganic elements that originate from rocks, soil, or water. 
                    However, you can absorb them indirectly from the environment or an animal that has eaten a particular plant.
                    There are many minerals, but certain ones are necessary for optimal health. 
                    Minerals are split into two groups: major and trace. 
                    Major ones are not necessarily more important than trace, but it means there are greater amounts in your body.
